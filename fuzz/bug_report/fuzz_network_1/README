### TESTING A BUG ###

To test a bug in this folder, you need, from a merge of the fuzzing and fuzzingReport branch :

	(-1) (any standard mysql-server compilation requirement may apply here)

	(0) go into mysql-server folder, create a build folder for compilation

	(1) go in it, do : cmake .. -DFUZZING=1
	(1bis) you may need to do : cmake .. -DDOWNLOAD_BOOST=1 -DWITH_BOOST=./ -DFUZZING=1

	(2) make fuzz_network_1_client
		(the source file can be found in fuzz/client_fuzz/fuzz_network_1_client.cc)

	(3) make server_fuzz
		(the source file can be found in fuzz/server_fuzz/server_fuzz.cc)

	(4) in one shell, run ./bin/server_fuzz PATH/TO/CRASH/FILE
	    (right now, the server port is hardcoded as 1232)

	(5) in another shell, run ./bin/fuzz_network_1_client

	(6) If you didn't merge fuzzingFix branch, the bug should be obvious.
		If you did merge this branch, a mysql error should appear
