### GENERALITIES AND BRANCHES USED ###
This is the directory used for fuzzing, intended to be used with oss-fuzz. 
There are three mains git branches used for fuzzing :
	- fuzzing branch (which contains files necessary for fuzzing)
	- fuzzingReport branch (which contains information on bugs found)
	- fuzzingFix branch (which contains fix to bugs found)
 
For testing locally, a branch can be made for fuzzing and, as need be, fuzzingReport and fuzzingFix can be merged into it.

### TESTING A BUG ###

Bugs found are categorized in the fuzzingReport branch in the fuzz folder. They are further classified depending into folders depending on which fuzz target found them.
A finished fuzz_target can have an easy way to test it without having to do the whole fuzzing process (which also helps confirming there is indeed a problem and it isn't just an issue with the fuzzing).
Details on how to test a particular bug for a partial fuzz target can be found in the folder of the fuzz target in the fuzzingReport branch.
